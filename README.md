No code to upload this time! 

I've worked through the JavaScript course by freeCodeCamp. The way it's structured meant it wasn't time efficient to create a seperate file for every part of the course and commenting out sections within the same documents wasn't neat.
I followed along with the course using Scrimba's web IDE. I'm quite familiar with the concepts already but I've got an understanding of how to apply them in JavaScript now. I'll upload any projects I work on using JS here.
